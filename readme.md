Description

For this assignement we had to create a JavaScript quiz. I used the example questions in class description for the 
JavaScript questions. What you will see happeneing in the code is a timer counting down, elements created through 
JavaScript, event listeners, appending and local storage. 

I had a little fun with this one. I originally wanted to do more with the Mortal Kombat theme, but just ran out of time due to traveling. I want to go back and add music, sounds and other character just for fun. 

I got the cool animated sprite from CodePen:
